Expand Loan Products for High-Demand Purposes: Create specialized financial products or bundled services for popular categories like debt consolidation and home improvement to attract more qualified applicants and increase customer retention.


Strengthen Risk Monitoring for Bad Loans: Although bad loans represent only 13.82%, further analysis and monitoring of these accounts can help reduce future risk and improve the portfolio's overall health.


Optimize Interest Rate Strategy: While a 12% average interest rate is reasonable, consider flexible interest structures or rewards for early repayments to enhance competitiveness and borrower satisfaction.
